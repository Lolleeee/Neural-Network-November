\section{Introduction}
The challenge involves developing a neural network model for binary classification on a dataset of blood cell images. Our initial step was to inspect the dataset to understand the nature of the images we would be working with. During this process, we identified and removed several outlier images to ensure the quality and consistency of the data. We also notice that the number of images per classes was not equal so we manage to augment the classes to make the dataset balanced. Given our initial lack of experience with image classification tasks, we decided to approach the problem using transfer learning with a pre-trained model. To balance computational efficiency and accuracy, we selected MobileNetV2, a model known for its favorable trade-off between parameter count and accuracy, as the foundation for our experiments. Later, we selected other models that were better suited to our purpose, incorporating fine-tuning to further enhance our performance.
